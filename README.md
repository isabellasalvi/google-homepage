WHAT: Deconstructing an existing web page and rebuilding it. 

NOTE: The links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it.

GOAL: To start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

WHAT I LEARNED:
How to perform the fundamentals of HTML and CSS to get a functioning webpage

CHALLENGES: 
1) Figuring out how the margines and various positioning worked
2) How to edit the font
3) How to work with containers to organize the contents of the webpage better
